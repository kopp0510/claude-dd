# Comprehensive Code Review

You are coordinating a comprehensive code review using specialized agents with explicit focus on configuration safety and production impact.

## What this command dispatches

**What is actually deployed** (claude-dd `PROMOTED_AGENTS`): `code-reviewer`, `code-simplifier`,
`security-auditor`, `senior-devops` — all **agents**, not skills. There are no `secret-scanner`
or `dependency-auditor` components; earlier versions of this section named them and they have
never existed in this repo.

**This Command Coordinates:**
- Dispatches `security-auditor` via the Task tool for the security dimension
- Reviews architecture and performance inline (no dedicated sub-agent for either)
- Prioritizes issues by severity (CRITICAL → LOW)
- Provides comprehensive recommendations

**Workflow:** This command reviews inline + dispatches the security agent → Comprehensive report

## Review Process

1. **Context Analysis**: First understand what code is being reviewed
2. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Use Task tool to delegate to specialized agents:
   - `@security-auditor` for security vulnerabilities, configuration safety and
     production reliability
   - Review architectural and performance concerns directly in this command's
     context (no dedicated sub-agents are deployed for these dimensions)

3. **Configuration Safety Priority**: Pay special attention to:
   - Database connection strings and timeouts
   - API endpoints and rate limits
   - Cache configurations and TTL values
   - Feature flags and environment variables
   - Deployment scripts and infrastructure changes

## Arguments Processing

- `--scope`: Determines what to review (staged, unstaged, pr, commit:hash, file:path)
- `--checks`: Focus areas (security, performance, style, maintainability, configuration)
- `--format`: Output format (detailed, json, markdown)
- `--severity`: Filter by severity level (critical, high, medium, low)
- `--output`: Save report to specified file

## Review Focus Areas

### Configuration Changes (CRITICAL)
- Verify environment-specific settings won't cause outages
- Check for hardcoded values that should be configurable
- Validate timeout and retry configurations
- Review database migration safety

### Security Analysis
- Authentication and authorization checks
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secret management and exposure prevention
- Dependency vulnerability assessment

### Performance Impact
- Query optimization and N+1 problems
- Caching strategy effectiveness
- Resource utilization patterns
- Scalability considerations

### Code Quality
- Maintainability and readability
- Test coverage and quality
- Documentation completeness
- Error handling robustness

## Output Format

Provide a consolidated report with:
1. **Executive Summary**: Key findings and recommendations
2. **Critical Issues**: Must-fix items (especially configuration risks)
3. **Security Findings**: Vulnerability assessment
4. **Performance Recommendations**: Optimization opportunities
5. **Code Quality Observations**: Style and maintainability notes
6. **Action Plan**: Prioritized steps for remediation

Focus on actionable feedback with specific examples and fixes.
